<h2> Welcome </h2>
	<p style="font-size:2vw;"> My name is Victoria Sanchez, and I am the owner of De Novo Beauty. I am a creative and professional makeup artist who strives to make everyone feel comfortable in their skin. Makeup can be intimidating to people who haven’t experimented with it, so I will always explain every step to ensure it’s what you want! I offer makeup for all events, including weddings, photo shoots, parties, and more! Anyone and everyone are welcome in my chair! I’m so excited to meet you and tailor your experience!</p>
	<h2> About Me </h2>
	<p style="font-size:2vw;"> I am originally from San Diego, CA, but I have resided in Denver, CO for more than 15 years. My passion for makeup started at a young age, and through hard work and dedication, I turned that passion into a full-fledged career. I have received my Esthetician's certficate in October of 2021, graduating as the valedictorian with the highest volume of sales and services out of all five classes. After graduating, I received my license the following January and immediately started getting to work! I was a licensed makeup artist at Sephora for two years, perfecting my craft. I specialize in combining and customizing services for each client, giving each person a unique and personal experience that will leave them satisfied and confident in their looks. I strive to make everyone and everyone feel comfortable and welcome in my space.</p>
