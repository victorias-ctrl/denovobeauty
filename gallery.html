<h1> Full Face</h1>
<p style="font-size:2vw;"> This look was for Senior graduation photos. She asked for a light eyeshadow that complimented her eyes, and she asked to focus more on complexion as the photos were outside during the day, and it was 95 degrees out. She added on false lashes as well.  </p>

<h1> Going-All-Out Glam</h1>
<p style="font-size:2vw;"> This look was for a bridesmaid. Although this would normally be in a bridal package, she wanted a more elaborate look that included a cut crease and graphic liner. The Going-All-Out Glam includes lashes, and we picked ones that perfectly suited her look.</p>

<h1> Tutorial</h1>
<p style="font-size:2vw;"> This look was a tutorial for someone who wanted to freshen up their look for date nights! We went through products that best suited her features, skin type, and wants. We created this beautiful look by working together. Lashes were added onto this look, and I taught her how to put them on. </p>
