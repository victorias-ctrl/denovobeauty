	<h2> Makeup Application Tutorial - Step 1: Skincare </h2>
<p style="font-size:2vw;"> 
	First, to get the best makeup application, start with skincare. Skincare balances your pH and creates a smooth base for your application. Start with using your preferred cleanser. Wash your face with cleansing manipulations, getting into the folds of the face and ensuring that you get all the dirt and debris off. After rinsing your face with warm water, pat dry, do not rub. Pick out your favorite serum, preferably something that will balance your skin. If you have larger pores or combination skin, try a niacinamide serum. If you have more dry skin, try something with hyaluronic acid. This will help keep balance. Place your serum all over the face, or if you have combination skin, place it on the areas you find most problematic. An optional step after the serum is eye cream. If you find more dryness under your eyes or would like more brightening, this option will help. After the serum and optional eye cream are manipulated into the skin, it is time for your moisturizer. Again, this moisturizer will be based on your preferences and skin type. Having the right moisturizer will make all the difference in how your foundation lays. Hydration and balance are crucial for makeup application. 
	<strong>Now that the base is ready, you can start with the makeup application!</strong></p>
<h2> Makeup Application Tutorial - Step 2: Foundation </h2>
<p style="font-size:2vw;">
	Place your foundation of choice on the back of your hand to apply evenly on your brush. Foundation choices could change based on your preference for dewy, natural, or matte finishes. A foundation that works best with your skin type is also crucial. If you're drier, you wouldn't want a very matte finish without a heavy moisturizer because it could make you look drier. If you're more combination/oily, you should stray from dewy foundations, as it would make you more oily or give you a "greasy" feeling. Also, something to consider is the coverage. There are light, medium, and full coverage foundations, and some are buildable. Depending on your preference, the tool you use can also have an impact. Your fingers and hands will have the lightest coverage. In terms of brushes, a larger, fluffier brush will give you less coverage, but you can build. A foundation brush that is dense and stiff will apply more foundation. With your preferences in mind, start to apply your foundation evenly. After the face, or if you choose to spot conceal, is finished, you can put some color back in. </p>
